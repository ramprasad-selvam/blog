# blog
Welcome to my personal blog, where I share thoughts, experiences, and insights on technology, self-growth, and everyday life. From coding experiments and career lessons to travel stories and creative ideas, this space reflects my journey of learning, exploring, and building a meaningful, self-reliant life.
